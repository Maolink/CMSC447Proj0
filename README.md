# CMSC447Proj0
School Project that involved making an application that would allow COEIT students at UMBC to organize their entire four year undergrad track.

To the TA:

if you want to run, cd to academic-pathways and do "npm start" in terminal
then, open another terminal and go to the root directory of this file and do "python3 manage.py runserver"

you might need to install some of the components we used, like schedule-x. Look at imports to know which components need to be installed.

If you still don't get it working, contant nick (nbenner1@umbc.edu) and i can help get it running on your machine, or I can give you a live demo. 
This works on my machine as I already completed demo for the presentation.
