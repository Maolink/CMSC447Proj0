It's typical for an organization to have a few terabytes of data maintained for different purposes by different business units stored in different formats, and for someone to have an idea about how the data might bring significant additional value. Data scientists are the bridge between the idea and the data and help extract latent value, often uncovering novel insights and novel beneficial ways to use the data in the process.",
