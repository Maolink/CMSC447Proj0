The basic concepts of number theory lead to modular arithmetic; ideals in rings; and to examples of integral domains, division rings and fields as quotient rings. The concept of primes yields the algebraic concepts of unique factorization domains, Euclidean rings, and prime and maximal ideals of rings. Examples of symmetries in number theory and geometry lead to the concept of groups whose fundamental properties and applications will be explored.",
